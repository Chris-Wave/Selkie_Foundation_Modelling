This is the Suction Caison foundation designer script

It makes use of the foundation_characterisitcs class

It defines the foundation dimensions and soil type. 

It will then determine if the caisson can penetrate the foundation under its
self-weight and if it can be set to its required depth wiothout violating the
limits imposed on the structure. 

The backend performs the necessary calculations to see if this design
will pass the necessary checks

It will then return an array with different diimensions which pass each of the
three tests. Further array manipulation will is then handled here which will then
provide the smallest dimensions which pass all three tests
