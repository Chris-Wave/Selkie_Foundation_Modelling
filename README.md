# Selkie Foundation Modelling
The Selkie Project aims to develop shared multi-used engineering tools, templates, standards and models for the Wave & Tidal Energy Sectors in both Wales and Ireland. 


Gavin & Doherty Geosolutions is a partner company in the Selkie Project. It specialises in geotechnical design engineering applications. Under this project, GDG is developing open-source packages for foundation modelling - Gravity Based and Suction Caissons. The packages include options for a variety of geotechnical parameters. 


This current repository develops libraries for the two foundation types and provides Pythonic source codes. It also includes sample scripts to make use of thesecodes. 

## Version 0: V0.00
Please note that this is still in progress and a stable version is yet to be released. Once released, users can directly download and use the library as a standard issue. For now however, the entire repo needs to be cloned for use. 


The source codes and their respective documentation can be found in the two seperate folders: Gravity Based Foundation and Suction Caisson.    


## Requirements

The algorithm makes use of Python 3.9 only. 

The libraries used and their respective versions used are as follows:

- Pandas - v1.3.5
- Numpy - v1.22.0
